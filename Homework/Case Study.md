## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would advise making more altcoins available on their platform.  However, this could be a difficult ask, since Coinbase is a regualted exchange.  The extensive regulatory environment can limit their ability to list certain coins.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Having more available coins based on the demand could drive more traffic through their platform/exchange.  More traffic would result in more revenues and subscribers.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Most of the altcoins avaialable still utilize blockchain technology.  Too my knowledge there wouldn't be any additional technologies required in order to provide these altcoins to the current subscriber base.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Additional product offerings can lead to increased subscribers which in turn would lead to increased revenue for the platform.
